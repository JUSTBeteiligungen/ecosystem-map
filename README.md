# Polkadot ecosystem map

ðŸ‘‹ This repository is the data source for the community-sourced Ecosystem directory curated by JUST Opensource team. 

Our aim is to curate an accurate, up-to-date database of projects in the Polkadot ecosystem to help orient the new teams and provide a solid base for user research and collaboration for already existing teams. Therefore, we have made this an open, community-driven repo to which anyone can contribute.

Itâ€™s a shared space for all of us to geek out on cool projects where we aim to pursue the values of Web3 and maintain an open and transparent environment. We do, however, reserve the right to omit some projects or metrics without further explanation.

As things change and grow, so does this repo. It may evolve over time as the community helps our team maintain the map going forward and propose new ideas and directions.
